    "Singapore is one of the largest metropolises in the world where over 5 million people live and 2nd densed country in the world with 7,804 persons per square kilometer. Singapore are subdivided into 28 districts in total. As a potential property investor in Singapore, identifying underpriced and overpirced properties is crucial. The property prices are well-known to correlate with three major factors: 1) type property tenure, 2) distance from city central area, and 3) proximity with major shopping/restaurant areas.\n",
